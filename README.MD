Boo Game
========

####Usage

The arrow keys move [Big Boo](http://www.mariowiki.com/Big_Boo) around, and surrounded by circling Boos which follow. The mouse moves [Bill Blaster](http://www.mariowiki.com/Bill_Blaster), and the launcher automatically rotates towards Big Boo. 

####Status

Executes. Shows tracer lines for debugging.


####Planned

Planned to expand into having a way to launch the Boos at the Bill Blaster, and to compensate the Blaster would have a significantly larger amount of hit points.
